Version 1.2 November 4, 2002 Update to file format reference image

reference_jp2/jp2_5.tif has been changed to the file that was
in the archive as tmp_ref5.tif. The old jp2_5.tif was mistakenly
included from an old version.

Note that it was discovered that p0_03 and p0_15 are identical. This
was an error, but it is easiest not to change the error.

Version 1.1 March 27, 2002 Update to file format tests

testfiles_jp2/file5.jp2 and testfiles_jp2/file7.jp2 have been modifed
to be JP2 compatible JPX files, rather than JP2 "only" files. This was
the way the files were in versions prior to the FDIS release, and the
way the Part 4 text describes the files. (reference_jp2/jp2_5.tif
unchanged)(reference_jp2/jp2_7.tif unchanged)

descriptions_j2p/file5.desc updated to match

descriptions_j2p/file7.desc updated to match

testfiles_jp2/file8.jp2 has been fixed, the JP2 wrapper was incorrect
for codestream contained. (reference_jp2/jp2_8.tif unchanged)

descriptions_j2p/file8.desc updated to match

Version 1.0 February 27, 2002 FDIS release
